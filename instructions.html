    <p>Eight-ball pool can be played as a singles or doubles game and is played
        with cues and 16 balls, 15 object balls, and one cue ball (the ball the players strike 
        to try and hit the other balls). Pool can be a relatively high-speed game compared to 
        its close relatives snooker and billiards but that makes it no less skilful with players 
        requiring a high degree of skill, concentration, and tactical thinking to play the game 
        at a high level.
    </p>
    <h2>Objective of the game</h2>
    <p>The object of pool is to pot all of your designated balls (either stripes or solids) 
        and then pot the 8 ball, thus winning the game. As pool matches often consist of several
        games in a ‘best out of’ format, players attempt to win as many games as needed to win 
        the match. Players must use their skills in both attack and safety play, as well as 
        tactical nous to help them win the match.
    </p>
    <h2>How to win the game</h2>
    <p>
        8 Ball pool is won when one of the following occurs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A player pots all of their designated balls and then legally pockets the 8 ball into their nominated pocket.</li>
        <li>The opposing player illegally pots the 8 ball before clearing their own set of balls.</li>
        <li>The 8 ball is knocked of the table by the opposition.</li>
    </ul>
